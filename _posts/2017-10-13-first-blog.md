Recently I am working on a project that can automatically grade a Web Fundamental belt exam for Coding Dojo. 

Today I have more knowledge on headless web browser. And web automation tool like selenium which is a portable software-testing framework for web applications. So that I can use selenium to power headless driver like PhantomJS to look into a html file that comes with a css file.

Later I figure out PhantomJS is not very friendly on rendering CSS, it pushes the width of the window and does not display like chrome. Then I find out that google recently release headless browser mode for chrome. That means I can now install chrome web driver and use chrome as my headless browser for my project.
